# Part 3 : JavaScript (vue)

---

# What is JavaScript ?

JavaScript adds the interactivity or "Logic" that HTML and CSS lacks  

---

# What is Vue ?
 
Vue is a popular JavaScript framework for making webpages

---

# Example: Quantity button

Try click plus or minus button !

/src/components/HelloWorld.vue
```html
<div class="button-group col">
    <button @click="quantity -= 1">-</button>
    <div class="text-display">{{ quantity }}</div>
    <button @click="quantity += 1">+</button>
</div>
```

---

# How it works ?

The button 

```html
<button @click="quantity += 1">+</button>
```
@click is a special attribute for Vue that lets you put in a function or short function inside.  
The function will run when the button is clicked
In this case, it adds quantity by one.

---

# Where is the quantity (variable) stored ?

Inside `<script>` tag of HelloWorld.vue
```js 
  data() {
    return {
      quantity: 0,
      // blah blah
    };
  },
```

---

# How is the number displayed inside HTML content ?

use double curly braces {{ }} to insert variable inside HTML

```html
<div class="text-display">{{ quantity }}</div>
```

---

# What if you want to do complex function ?

Most of the functions are stored in methods

```js
methods: {
    doSomethingDifficult() {
        // Do lots of stuff
        this.title = 'somethingCool';
    }
}
```

use **this** to refer to the variable you stored in **data()**

---
