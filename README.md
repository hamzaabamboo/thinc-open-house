# Thinc Open House Frontend Workshop

Welcome to Thinc First Code !
Today we'll be making your own shop-like web page using `vue` !!!

## Why Vue ?

Vue is a very good modern framework for beginners. It has a very low learning curve and quite nice to use.

## Setting it up

To set this project up first you have to clone this project (or download from github)

Then you will have to install all dependencies with

```bash
$ npm install
# or
$ yarn
```

Then, to start the server, type the following command

```bash
$ npm run serve
# or
$ yarn serve
```

Now, once you got everything setted up, Let's get started !!!

## Part 1 : Let's understand this page layout
